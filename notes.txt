Currently NN algorithm not great.
- Doesn't get best matches since it's the greediest implementations
- If match isn't found, moves to the end of the queue which could cause starvation. Scenario where someone enters the queue that is a match (to multiple good people) but takes the only match for that person

Some changes could be made.
- Take the minimum distance and create a game. Better matches but could cause starvation again by taking away potential matches or more likely that the first person to the enter the queue never finds a match
- Instead of moving the person with highest priority to the end, could iterate from highest priority to lowest priority restarting every time a new player is added to the queue


Player has...
- Create a cost function for each player to determine X
- Create multiple hash functions
- Take the intersection of the hashed buckets
- Players in the same bucket can be matched together
